# Sources

A list of Open Source projects that were very helpful for the development of this project.

- The Dugeon map is based on [Funny Map](https://github.com/Harry282/FunnyMap) which in turn is based on [Illegal Map](https://github.com/UnclaimedBloom6/IllegalMap).
- [Skytils](https://github.com/Skytils/SkytilsMod) was a very useful source to look up things in general.
